# Install and Running

* 1-) First of all, copy the repository via the GitHub link.
* 2-) The project consists of two different parts as backend and frontend. That's why ```npm install``` command should be run in root location first.
* 3-) Then go to the fronted location with the ```cd frontend``` command and perform the previous install here as well.
* 4-) After the installation process is finished, go to the root file location and run the backend server with the ```npm start``` command.
* 5-) After starting the backend server, go to the frontend location and run the frontend part of the project with the ```npm start``` command. The web application running on the local host will automatically open.
